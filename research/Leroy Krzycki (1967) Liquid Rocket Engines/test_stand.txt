TEST STAND

	The amateur rocket engine test stand is a structure which incorporates a 
method for firmlyr mounting the rocket engine (preferably in a nozzle-down 
attitude), a mounting for the propellant flow control needle valves, the 
fuel tank and associated plumbing, and the oxygen and nitrogen cylinders 
with regulators and associated plumbing. The operator's station, which
is really a part of the test stand, should be physically separated from 
the test stand proper by at least 20 feet, witll a shrapnel barricade 
between. The operator's station should contain the control valve extensions,
the ignition system battery and associated switches, and a mirror system 
so that the operator does not directly view the operating rocket engine.
	Th greatest hazard in testing small rocket enoines is from shrapnel 
in the event of engine explosion or disintigration. Therefore, the test 
stand proper should be suitably barricaded to reduce shrapnel effect 
in all directions.

	Figure 12 shows schematically the proper arrangement of components 
for a safe rocket engine test stand. The rocket engine is separated from
the propellant flow control valves by a 1/8-inch thick steel barricade. 
The engine is firmly attached to a section of steel channel in the nozzle
down position.  This is the safest orientation for a liquid-fuel rocket engine
since excess fuel, in the event of an ignition failure, simply drains out of 
the engine nozzle.  The engine is mounted high enough from the ground so that 
no flame chute or other complicated exhaust deflector or fixture is required.
The compressed gas cylinders (one nitrogen and two oxygen) are mounted
at the rear of the test stand and are separated from the control valves 
compartment by another barricade made from one-inch thick plywood. The
nitrogen and oxygen regulators are mounted on this plywood barricade 
above the cylinders. In this manner, expended cylinders may he replaced
with charged cylinders without disturbing the regulators or plumbing.
A formed piece of stainless steel tubing between the oxygen manifold and
the oxygen regulator and a similar piece of tubing between the 
nitrogen cylinder and its regulator are removed during cylinder exchange, 
and then reconnected. Lines should always be capped when not in use to 
prevent entry of dirt and other foreign objects.
	The fuel tank is mounted beteeen the forward steel barricade and the rear 
plywood barricade on a metal cross-piece attached to both barricades. 
The tank is mounted in the vertical position with the liquid outlet at 
the bottom.
	The propellant flow control valves are mounted one atop the other 
in a metal bracket which is attached to the forward steel barricade. 
Panel mounted needle valves are recommended since they facilitate mounting 
in the manner described, and do not place mounting or operating stresses 
on the propellant flow tubing. Valve stem extensions, made from 1/4-inch
pipe permit operation

of the control valves from the operator's remote control station, which is 
located at least twenty feet from the test stand proper. Pressure gauges 
for fuel tank pressure, oxygen line pressure, cooling water exit pressure
and combustion chamber pressure are mounted in a panel which is
attached to the forward and rear barricades and which faces the 
operator's remote station.

	Cooling water for the rocket engine is brought into a hose coupling 
attached to the stand, with semi-permanent plumbing between the coupling 
and the rocket engine. Water flowing from the cooling jacket should be 
directed away from the engine or can be directed downward onto a 3-inch
deep layer of coarse stones laid beneath the roeket engine exhaust. 
These stones will prevent the engine exhaust from picking up dirt and 
dust; the water will cool the stones and extend their useful life. The 
jet of cooling water can be observed by the operator as an indication 
that cooling water is actually flowing through the engine.

	The test stand proper should have a framework made from welded or 
bolted steel angle. The forward steel and rear plywood barricade are 
bolted to this angle framework providing rigidity and strength. 
Thee test stand should be firmly attached to the surface Of the test 
area either by bolting to a concrete pad or by weighing down with sand
bags or concrete weights.

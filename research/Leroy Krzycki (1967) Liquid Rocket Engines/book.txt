Foreword

The rocket engine is a relatively simple device in which propellants
are burned and the resulting high pressure gases are expanded through
a specially shaped nozzle to produce thrust.  Gas pressurized
propellant tanks and simple propellant flow controls make operation
of a small liquid-fuel rocket engine about as simple as operating an
automobile engine.  Why then do so many amateur rocket engines fail or
cause injury?  The reason, usually and simply, is that the amateur is
not accustomed to high pressure devices operating near material
temperature limits.  His normal everyday life is, instead, filled with
devices and gadgets operating at low pressures and at low thermal
energy levels.  With proper design, careful workmanship, and good test
equipment, operated in a safe manner, the amateur can build small,
liquid-fuel rocket engines which will have hours of safe operating
life.

The puropse of this publication is to provide the serious amateur
builder with design information, fabrication procedures, test
equipement requirements, and safe oeprating procedures for small
liquid-fuel rocket engines.

FABRICATION

	The fabrication and assembly of a small liquid fuel rocket
engine is no more difficult than the more serious amateur machine
projects, such as model steam engines, gasoline engines, and
turbines.  Because the rocket engine has no rotating parts,
dynamic balance of components is not required.  However, the
use of quality, homogeneous materials and careful fabrication
technique are definitely required to produce a safe, working
rocket engine.
	A properly desgined small liquid-fuel rocket engine
requires the following machine and hand tools:

1. 6" or 10" metal-turning lathe, with attachments
2. Precision drill press
3. hand files, calipers, micrometers, etc.
4. oxy-acetylene torch or small arc welder.

Since a properly designed engine will have symmetrical parts, a
milling machine or planer will not be required. The metal-turning
lathe should have a repeatable accuracy of 0.001 inch. The drill press
will he used to drill small diameter holes and should have a true
running, high speed chuck.

Mensuration equipment such as calipers, micrometers, etc., must be
capable of inside and outside diameter measurements, lengths, and
should be used to locate holes, recesses, and other features prior to
actual machining.

	The joining of the various engine components is especially
critical since the engine will operate at high pressure and high
temperature.

The ability of the welder, and the welding techniques employed, should
be as good as those required for aircraft work. Metal joints must be
clean, vith a close fit between parts to ensure adequate weld strength
and integrity. To the extent possible assembled conponents should be
tested with water (or nitrogen gas, but that is dangerous) prior to
actual use with propellants. Repair of leaks or initially poor welds
must be carefully done with subsequent re-testing with pressurized
water (called hyrdo-testing or hydrostatic testing).

	As discussed previously, the combustion chamber should built
as a one-piece unit.  This arrangement, while more difficult from a
machining point of view, eliminates the requirement for a joint of
some knd between the two parts; this joint would be exposed to the hot
combustion gases (5700 degF) on one side and would, in all
probability, fail.  Building the combustion chamber and nozzle in one
piece eliminates this potential failure point.  Care must be exercised
during the machining of the copper chamber/nozzle to ensure constant
wall thickness and the correct taper in the nozzle region.  Thin wall
sections are potential failure points and could result in almost
immediate catastrophic failure during firing.

	Machining of the outer shell or jacket is less critical than
the combustion chamber/nozzle.  Typical materials for this part are
stainless steel or brass. The inside diameter of the shell should have
a smooth finish to reduce cooling pressure drop, nnd the outside
finish of the shell, which will be visible to the world, should
reflect the care and concern of the machinist.  The shell will also
contain the coolant entry and exit ports. Since the coolant (typically
water) will probably have an entry pressure of 60 to 100 psi, these
ports and fittings should be constructed with some care. The use of
flare type fittings with metal tapered seats (such as those
manufactured by Parker or Weatherland) is highly reccomended.  The
shell will also feature a method of attaching the injector and for
mounting the engine to a test or thrust stand.  As shown in Figure 8,
these two mounting requirements can be easily combined to simplify the
design.  The forces to be considered when designing the shell are not
the thrust forces (which are small, typically on the order of 20-30
lbs) but, rather the pressure forces attempting to separate the
injector from the shell.  The pressure acting on the injector area out
to the point of sealing between the injector and the outer shell is the
combistion chamber pressure, which is typically 100 to 300 psi.  The
force attempting to separate the injector from the shell is slightly
over 600 lbs for the design shown in Figure 8 at a combustion
pressure of 300 psi.  The bolts holding the two components together
(and in this case also holding the assembly to the test mount) must
withstand this force with and adequate safety factor (typically a
factor of two).  THe number and size of bolts required can be obtained
from Table IV, which gives the average load capacity of high strength
steel bolts of various sizes.  The strength of these bolts, however,
depends to some extent on the adequacy of the threads in tapped holes,
the tapped material, and the bolt tightening procedure used in
assembly.

high Strength Steel Bolts, SF = 2

Bolt Size | Load Capacity, lb

10-32		1500
1/4-20		2400
1/4-28		2750
3/8-16		5800

	The outer shell must also contain a sealing device to prevent
the high pressure combustion chamber gas from flowing back past the
injector.  With an appropriately configured water-cooled design, the
use of an elastomeric O-ring is highly desirable.  A standard neoprene
O-ring (manufactured by a number of companies, see List of Suppliers)
will give reliable service if the surrounding metal does not exceed a
temperature of 200-300 degF .  Dimenstions and design parameters for
O-rings and O-ring grooves are given in maufacturers supply catalogs.

	Another method of sealing is the use of an asbestos-copper
crush gasket (very similar to those used on automobile sparkplugs,
only larger; see List of Suppliers).  The copper crush gasket is
positioned by a V-groove cut in the surface of the outer jacket at the
sealing point. The mating surface of the injector should be smooth and
flat with no machine marks.

	Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between an O-ring and a
copper crush gasket and their mating surfaces.


Figure 9 Detail on O-ring and crush gasket sealing methods. O-ring
groove dimensions are critical and should be obtained from suppliers
handbooks. Crush gasket groove dimensions are non-critical; groove
depth should be about 1/3 the thickness of uncrushed gasket.

 	The injector should be fabricated from copper to provide
maximum heat transfer from the injector face to the incoming
propellants. The outer shell of the injector can be made from either
copper, stainless steel, or brass. However, since the propellant inlet
fittings (again these should be the tapered seat, metal-to-metal kind)
should he stainless steel for best results.  It is usually a good idea
to make the injector outer shell from stainless steel so that the
inlet fittings can be arc welded. Then the outer shell can be attached
to the remainder of the injector by silver brazing without weakening
the inlet fitting welds.

	Injection holes for the gaseous oxygen (and for the fuel, if
impinging jets are used) will usually be made with numbered drills of
small diameter.  Extreme care should be used in drilling these holes,
especially in soft copper.  The drilled hole should have an entry and
exit free from burrs or chips.  It is vitally important that injector
components be thoroughly cleaned and deburred prior to assembly.
After injector welding, hot water should be used to thoroughly clean
the injector assembly of brazing flux and residues, and the assembly
should receive a final rinse in acetone or alcohol.

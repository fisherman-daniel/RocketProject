SAFETY

	Because of the physical hazards involved in handling propellants and 
controlling high pressure combustion proeesses, certain elementary safety 
precautions must be observed in static testing of rocket engines. During 
the design, and later, the operation of amateur liquid rocket engines, the 
following general safety precautions shou1d be observed:

1. The operator should be protected by a suitable barricade located
some distance (at least 20 feet) from the test unit.

2. Control of valves during engine ignition and steady-state
operation should be by remote means, which for amateur units is
best achieved by manual control of needle valves via valve stem
extensions.

3. A large chemical fire extinguisher (or, at least, a plentiful
supply of water) should always be on hand.

4. The operator shOuld not view the test unit directly, but should use 
a mirror arrangement (somewhat like a periscope) or use a thick layer of 
reinforced safety glass attached to the operator's barricade. REMEMBER, 
the primary danger is from shrapnel in the event of engine explosion.

5. Separating of fuel and oxidizer storage reduces the fire and explosion 
hazard and limits the amount of propellant stowed in any one area.

6. The test stand unit should be barricaded on several sides to reduce 
shrapnel effect in event of explosion.

7 Valves, pressure pauges, and other components which directly sense fluid
properties should not be located in the operator's station, but should be 
on the test stand and remotely read. This rule does not apply to electrical 
instrumentation wherein a transducer is located on the test stand and an 
electrical readout (such as a meter) is located at the operator's station 
(this type of instrumentation is very expensive and is beyond the reach 
of most amateurs).

8. Warning signals should be given prior to tests (or whenever gas 
cylinder valves are open) to notify personnel that the area is hazardous. 
A test must NEVER be conducted until the operator has assured himself that
all personnel are behind safety barricades or otherwise protected.

9. Personnel should be permitted to work in the test area only if fuel 
and oxidizer are separated and not pressurized.

10. Personnel handling propellants should wear safety equipment such as 
gloves, face shields, or rubber aprons. Remember that most fuels are toxic;
do not breathe fuel vapors for even a short time.

11. No smoking is ever permitted anywhere near a test area when 
propellants are alse present, Remember vapors from hydrocarbon fuels
(such as gasoline) can travel long distances from the test area 
and can be ignited at a remote point travelling back to the test stand.

12. A check-off list is helpful when conducting a rocket engine firing 
and should be made up of both technical events and safety items to 
be completed prior to the firing.

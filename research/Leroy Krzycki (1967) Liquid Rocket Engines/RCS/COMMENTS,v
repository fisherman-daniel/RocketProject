Editing is largely closed, for the nonce.  I may make the HTML
editable after it settles a bit.  Handling of the equations is still
in flux and a modernizing appendix is warranted.

The HTML edition is at:

Paragraphs start with a single tab. 
Leave blank lines around equations and figure headings.
I'll set the equations with LaTeX and put them in as gifs.

Copy text into emacs (or your favorite editor) and then copy it back
before submitting changes if you are going to make a bunch.

Comment on "propellant choice":

(1) The Atlas is no longer a "missile" but has been converted into
a "space launch vehicle".

(2) The calculation assumes that there are no losses; i.e. ,that
the "maximum theoretical" Isp will be that which is achieved.
There are numerous loss terms not accounted for; hence the flowrate
given is incorrect.

(3) Modern launch vehicles operate fuel rich as stated; however it
is not due to a desire to reduce the combustion temperature.  Rather,
the kinetic losses (losses due to departure from full shifting
equilibrium) are a maximum at stoichiometric; the prudent designer
therefore selects a mixture ratio "off stoichiometric" in order to
minimize the kinetic losses.

Under "Parameters" there is one scrambled phrase which I can not discover
from context. (I think I fixed it -DR)

(noted, but I think it's better to have the book remain true to the original.
I'll collect comments and corrections such as these into an addendum -DR)

I graduated from College and was commisioned in the USAF today (6/7).
Yay.

Comment 6/12

Congratulations.

I've been thru the entire document; I can do nothing at all with the "conversions"
section because it is so badly scrambled.  I've done what I could with the
Suppliers but it needs lots of work.

There is a spot under 'check out' where I couldn't figure out the
author's intent; I improvised.  My version says that a new source of
water "will" be required...I'm not sure what the author had in mind.
Let me know if you have difficulty finding the spot I'm talking about.

Who else has been working on this besides me & you?

(I'm back from the beach.) 
It looks like you and I have done the brunt of it.  One or two other 
people have helped some.  Wayne Gramlich offered to help (he also has
a copy of the book) but I know he's been traveling.

I found the spot you mentioned.  The original said "may" not "will" but 
otherwise you had it right.  I'm going to start on the conversion to HTML.

The conversions section isn't particularly important anyway.

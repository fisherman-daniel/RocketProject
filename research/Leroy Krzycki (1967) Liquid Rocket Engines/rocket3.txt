Gaseous Nitrogen Regulator

	The purpose of a regulator is to maintain a constant pressure
on the downstream side of the regulator as the pressure in the gas
cylinder on the upstream side decreases . A good quality regulator
will maintain the downstream pressure quite accurately over a range
of gas flow rates as long as the upstream cylinder pressure does not
decrease too close to the downstream pressure. Thus, all the gas in
the cylinder is not usable since some excess pressure (hence, gas) is
required to drive the gas throtlgll, anci lnaintain control of, the
regulator. The f low ratc of nitrogen gas required to forçe the
fuel from the tank is relatively small and coula be llandled by a
regular gaseous oxygen welding regu lator equipped with nitrogen
cylinder fittings. }low ever, most welding regulators do not permit
adjustment to tlle high downstream pressure required for rocket engine
operation. A number of commercial firms (see List of Suppliers)market
regulators for non-x.«elding purposes that are admirably suited for
fuel tank pressurization. Especially attractive is the Grove Mity-Mite
regulator with internal regulation. Inexpensive, special fittin,gs are
required to attach these regulators to the gas cylinder. These
fittings sre avai lable from several sources (see List of Suppl iers)

SAFETY

	lsecatlse of the pllysicnl llazards inXol e<3 in llandling propellants and eontrollinr higl] pressure eombustion proeesses, eertain clementarX safety precautions must be observed in static testing of rocket engines. During tlle dcsign, and later,tl]e operation Of amateur liquid rocket engines , the following p,encral safety prccautions shou1d be observed:

1. The operator should be protected by a suitable barricade located
some distance (at least 20 feet) from the test unit.

2. Control of valves (during engine ignition and steady-state
operation should be by remote means which for amateur units is
best achieved by manual control of needle valve via valve stem
extensions .

3. A large chemical fire extinguisher (or, at least, a plentiful
supply of water) should always be on hand.

4. The operator shOuld not view the test unit directly, but should use a mirror arrangement (somewllat like a periScope) or use a thick layer of reinforced safety glass attac}led to the operator}s barricade4 REMEMBER, the primary danger is from skrapnel in the event of engine
explosion .

5. Separating of fuel and oxidizer storage reduces the fire and explo8ion hazard and limits the amount of propellant stowed in any one area.

ó The test stand tlnit should be barricaded on several sides to redtRce shrapnel effect in event of explosion.

7 Valves,pressure pauges, and other componentS wllich directly sense fluid properties should not bc located in the °Perator's station, but sllould be on the te.ct stand and remotely read. This rule does not apply to electrical instrumentat
ion wherein a transdtlcer is located on the test stand and an electrical readout(such as a meter) is located at the °Perator's station (this type of instrtlmentation is very expensive and is beyond the reach of most amateurs).

ENsINE CHECK-OUT and CALIBRATION

	After tlle rocket engine l)as beerl faL.ricated. severa] clleck-out tests and flow calibrations slloul(l be made prior to testing witb lixte propellants

Leak Testing

	Connect the engine cooling jacket to a readily available source of pressurized water (such as lawn or house supply; pressure sllould be 50-100 psi witll no flow). Attach a pressure gauge to
 the outlet port of the jacket and open the water valve, allowing water to fill the jacket. Observe the jacket and engine for ] eaks . there shou id be no leaks .
	A similar pressure check should be performed on the fuel manifold of the injector. Since the in jector face is not easily blanked off, PX rfortlM this test by flowing neater through the in ¡( ctor. Use a f i l t er i n the va ter line to avo i (l p I vXgç i ny the small fuel in jection holes. IJss a pl f srf gauge attached to the water line as near t o tll. in jector fuel entry port as ¡ ossil)ls . fll( r
should he no 1 eaks .

Flow Calibration

	The water flow rate through the engine cnoling Jacket should be determined for various inlet pressures. Use a bathroom or other avai table scale to weigh, in a container, water flowing through the engine over a timed period. Water pressure can be measured either at the entrance or exit of the cooling jacket. Attach a flexible hose (garden variety will do) to the outlet of the cooling jacket and start water flowing through the jacket at the desire» pressure. IvlZen steady flow has been achieved quick1>t move the hose outlet into the catch container for a period of 30 seconds, then quickly remove the hose from the container Use a stop or sweep second watch for the timing and be accurate! Obtain the net weight of collected water by subtracting frown the weight of the filled container its empty weight. Divide the net weight by the time during which water was collected and the result will he water flow rate in lb/sec. This operation slloulci be repeated several times at different pressures to obtain the flow characteristics of the coolant jacket. If insufficient water pressure is available to achieve the design water flow rate, check the size of tubing or hose used between the water source and the

engine; it may be restricting tlze water flow ratr. Check Also the size of the flc> :ihle o ltlct hose uscd. If these t( sts show that greater pressure is required to act ievc tlle desired f lot* rate, a diffcrent source of cooling water eras be repaired.

	liken the t( st stand an(l operator ' s area are completed and Components installed tests should lze condtlcte(i to determine that no gas or l i fluid leaks will Occur xrl]en actual propellants are used Fi 11 the talllc with clean water. Cap off the fuel and Oxygen lines where thev x>ould normally attach to Ll]e engine. Pressurize the sxstem to 100 psi and check for leaks. A soap solution can be used to check around all fittings and seals. SOap hobbles indicate the presence of a gas leak . I f no leaks are present increase the pressure to 200 psi and repeat the clctection procedure. Continue this procedure until the test stand operating pressure is reached and no
 leaks are present. Depressurize the system and refill the fuel tank witll clean •at(r. Att.ncll the rocket engine to its test mount and connect all tubing. Presstlrize the stand in the normal manner and practice the ignition an(l ol)erating, sequence using water as fuel (gaseous oxygen cnn safely he usc(l in these tests, if desire(l). If no leaks develop, empty the fuel tank of water and dry Cry r I ushillg wi th nitrogen Fas for several
seconds. Tlle engine and test stand are now ready for their first hot firing.

IGNITION and OPERATION

	Discussion of propellant ignition has been reserved until this point since it is really a test stand function and is required only for actual operation of the engine. Tile propellants used in amateur rocket engines require a separate source for ignition. Because the engines are small, the use of an engine-mounted spark plug is not generally feasible. Even if it were, the ignition of incoming propellants in the combustion chamber by a small spark plug is clangerout and unreliable. Propellant timing is extremely important in a bi-propellant liquid rocket engine. An excess of either propellant (if both are liquid) in the combustion cl]amber can lead to severe over-pressure upon ignition (known as "lZard" start) and possible fracture of the combustion cllamher. Tlle amateur engine using gaseous oxygen is not nearly as sensitive to hard starts as if the Oxidizer were a liquid.
	Hundreds of tests with small liquidfuel rocket engines employing gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer have indicated that llot-source ignition provides excellent propellant ignition characteristics, and drastically reduces hard starts. Hot-source ignition works as follows: two lengths of insulated #16 or #18 solid wire are taped together and their exposed ends are bent to form a spark gap of about 3/32-inch. A small

The ignition procedvll-e, after the tc;t st;lnd is prepared for firing is:

Figure 13 lXot-source igniter for small liquid fuel rocket engines using gaseous oxygen oxidizer. Ignitor is consumed during each use and must be replaced.
 l . The operator ascertains that the area i s c tear and ready for f Bring.

2. The operator checks operation of the spark coil and then disconnects the coi l from the hattery for safety. The battery should be at the operator @ s remote station.

3. The ignitor cotton is soaked in gasoline or kerosene .

4. The ignitor is pushed through the nozzle into the combustion chamber and secured.

5. Gas cylinder valves are opened, the fuel tank is pressurized, and all gas pressures adjusted to operating values.

ó. Cooling water is allowed to flow throttle the engine at the proper rate.

7. The firing bell or horn is sounded. The spark coil is reconnected to its battery.

8. The oxygen flow needle valve is opened very slightly to allow a very small flow of gaseous oxygen to pass over the ignitor and out the combu s t i on ch amber .

9. The spark coil is energized. Inside the combustion chamber the cotton igitor should immediately burst into flame in the oxygen atmosphere. The operator may have difficulty ascertaining that the cotton i s actually burning although small flaming bits of material may be ejected from the nozzle.

The engine will abruptly stop operation and the operator can then turn of f the f loXv of gaseous oxygen. If the engine is to be stopped prior to fuel depletion the fuel flour control valve should be quickly turned off, followed t}y opening of the nitrogen purge valve.

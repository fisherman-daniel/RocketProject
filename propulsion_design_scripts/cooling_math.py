# Script to calculate dimensions of cooling passage for regenerative cooling.
# Based on Kryzcki book equations.

from nozzle_math import *

# coolant flow rate to absorb heat flowing through wall
Rch_outside = Rch + tch
# area to be cooled. assume cone is 1/4 the area
Acool = (2 * math.pi * Rch_outside) * Lch * 1.25
Qcool = qcool * Acool
m_dot_cool = Qcool / cp_fuel / dTcool
# m_dot_cool > m_dot_fuel, ie, more fuel is required to cool the engine than to run it

# coolant passage size. use smaller m_dot_fuel and hope it doesn't burn up?
Rcj_inside = math.sqrt(
    (m_dot_fuel / (math.pi * vcool * rho_fuel)) + Rch_outside ** 2)
tcool = Rcj_inside - Rch_outside

# cooling jacket thickness to withstand fuel pressure
tcj = Pinj_fuel * Rcj_inside / strength_steel
